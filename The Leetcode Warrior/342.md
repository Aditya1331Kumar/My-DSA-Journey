## some important points to leran:

---
```Java
1. n<=0 k liye no check for any power wagera
```
---
---

2.
A number is a **power of four** if:

* It‚Äôs positive.
* It‚Äôs also a **power of two** (only one bit set in binary).
* And that **one bit** is at an **odd position** in binary (counting from LSB starting at position 1).

Example:

```
1   -> 0001   (4^0) ‚úÖ  
4   -> 0100   (4^1) ‚úÖ  
16  -> 0001 0000 (4^2) ‚úÖ  
8   -> 1000   ‚ùå  (power of 2 but not power of 4)
```

---


```java
if ((n & (n - 1)) != 0) return false;
```

* This checks if `n` is a **power of two**.

---

```java
return (n & 0x55555555) != 0;
```

### **What‚Äôs `0x55555555`?**

* Hex `0x55555555` = Binary:

```
01010101010101010101010101010101
```

* This pattern has `1`s only in **odd positions** (1st, 3rd, 5th, ... if counting from LSB=1).
* Why? Because powers of 4 always have their `1` in an odd position.

---

---
```Java
3. LSB ‚Üí rightmost bit
```
---
---

4. 
-  Odd positions mask ‚Üí `0x55555555`

  ```
  Binary: 01010101 01010101 01010101 01010101
  (position count from LSB: 1,3,5,... par 1 hai)
  ```

* Even positions mask ‚Üí `0xAAAAAAAA`

  ```
  Binary: 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010
  (position count from LSB: 2,4,6,... par 1 hai)
  ```

**Position counting ka rule:**
LSB (least significant bit) ko position `1` maana jaata hai, uske baad next bit position `2`, phir `3`‚Ä¶ aur aise aage.


---
```
5. Because in binary, a bit can be either unset (0) or set (1) ‚Äî like an ON/OFF switch.
```
- 0 ‚Üí OFF ‚Üí unset bit

- 1 ‚Üí ON ‚Üí set bit

---
---
6. 
## **Second part of condition**

```java
Integer.bitCount(n - 1) % 2 == 0
```

* `Integer.bitCount(x)` counts **number of set bits** in the binary representation of `x`.
* Here, `x = n - 1`.

üí° **Key idea:**
If `n` is a power of 4, `n-1` has an **even number of 1's** in binary.
