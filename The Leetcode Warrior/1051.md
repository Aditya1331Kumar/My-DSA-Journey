9. matlab agar direct sort karte to nlogn hota and frequency store kara k karne se o(n) hota hai ?
```
```
✅ Jab Range chhoti ho (fixed max-min) → Counting sort best hai.
❌ Jab Range bahut badi ho (jaise 1 se 10^9) → Counting sort feasible nahi (memory blow-up ho jayega), tab normal sort better hai.

        int j=0;
        for(int i=0;i<101;i++){
            while(arr[i]>0){
                if(heights[j++]!=i) res++;
                arr[i]--;
            }
