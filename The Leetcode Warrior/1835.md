```java
class Solution {
    public int getXORSum(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        if(arr1.length<arr2.length){
            return getXORSum(arr2,arr1);
        }
        int xor1=0;
        for(int i:arr1){
            xor1^=i;
        }
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr2.length;i++){
            int xor=arr2[i]&xor1;
            ans=ans^xor;
        }

 # key idea 
 ```java
 (a1 & b1) ^ (a1 & b2) ^ ... ^ (an & bm) == (a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ an) & (b1 ^ b2 ^ ... ^ bm)
 ```
```java

class Solution {

    public int getXORSum(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int xor1 = 0;
        int xor2 = 0;

        // Step 1: Calculate XOR of all elements in arr1
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
            xor1 = xor1 ^ arr1[i];
        }

        // Step 2: Calculate XOR of all elements in arr2
        
        for (int j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            xor2 = xor2 ^ arr2[j];
        }
    
        return xor1 & xor2;
    }
}
