```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int start = 1;
        int end = n;
        
        while(start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                end = mid; // Move left but include mid (could be the first bad)
            } else {
                start = mid + 1; // Move right
            }
        }
        return start; // or end (both are same when loop breaks)
    }
}

 # recusrsion faster thena upar wala
```java

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        return binarysearch(1, n);
    }
    public int binarysearch(int l, int r) {
        if (l == r) return l;
        int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
        if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
            return binarysearch(l, mid);
        } else {
            return binarysearch(mid + 1, r);
