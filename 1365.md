 # optimized one  only when input is small 
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] smallerNumbersThanCurrent(int[] nums) {
        int[] freq = new int[101];   // values in [0,100]

        // frequency count
        for (int num : nums) {
            freq[num]++;
        }

        // prefix sum → how many numbers ≤ i
        for (int i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
            freq[i] += freq[i - 1];
        }

        int[] ans = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) ans[i] = 0;
            else ans[i] = freq[nums[i] - 1];  // smaller than nums[i]
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

 # thoda sa optimized using hash maps
```java

class Solution {
    public int[] smallerNumbersThanCurrent(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] sorted = nums.clone();
        Arrays.sort(sorted);

        // map: number → how many smaller
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            map.putIfAbsent(sorted[i], i);
        }

        int[] ans = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans[i] = map.get(nums[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
