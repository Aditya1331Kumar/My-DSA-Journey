 # gyan { two pointer kaha lagana hai !!! y}

## 🔑 General intuition

Two-pointer ka use tab hota hai jab:

1. **Array / String sorted ho ya monotonic property ho** (increasing/decreasing).

   * Sorting ke bina direction decide karna mushkil ho jata hai.
2. **Tumhe pair / triplet / subarray dhoondhna ho jo ek certain condition satisfy kare**.

   * e.g., sum == target, difference < k, product <= x, etc.
3. **Do sides se shrink/expand karne ka logic ban sakta ho.**

   * Jaise ek pointer left se, ek right se chale, aur tum condition ke hisaab se move kara sako.




## 🚦 Quick checklist: kab sochna chahiye two-pointer?

* ✅ Input **sorted** diya ho.
* ✅ Tumhe **pair / subarray / substring** dhoondhna ho.
* ✅ Tum **O(n²) brute force** ko **O(n)** me reduce karna chahte ho.
* ✅ Tumhare paas **direction ka control** ho (agar sum chhota hai → left++, sum bada hai → right--).

Agar input sorted nahi hai → pehle sort karo (agar problem allow kare) → fir two-pointer.
Agar sort karne se original indices preserve karne padte hain → tab HashMap better hoga.

 # binary search jaisa
```java
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * You do NOT implement it — LeetCode provides it.
 * int guess(int num);
 */

class Solution {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            // safe mid calculation to avoid overflow:
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int res = guess(mid); // -1, 0, or 1

            if (res == 0) {
                return mid;           // found
            } else if (res < 0) {     // secret < mid
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {                  // res > 0 → secret > mid
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // As per problem constraints this line is unreachable,
        // but we return -1 to satisfy method signature.
        return -1;
    }
}
