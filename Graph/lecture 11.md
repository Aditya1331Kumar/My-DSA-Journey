# Question:
* Determine if the graph contains any cycles.
# Approach:

### The algorithm steps are as follows:
*  BFS is a traversal: it visits the same level nodes simultaneously, and then moves to the next level. 

### The intuition is that we start from a node, and start doing BFS level-wise, if somewhere down the line, we visit a single node twice, it means we came via two paths to end up at the same node. It implies there is a cycle in the graph because we know that we start from different directions but can arrive at the same node only if the graph is connected or contains a cycle, otherwise we would never come to the same node again.  

# Approach:
- Queue:  (<source node, parent>)
- Visited array: an array initialized to 0 indicating unvisited nodes.  


- Push the pair of the source node and its parent data (<source, parent>) in the queue, and mark the node as visited. The parent will be needed so that we don’t do a backward traversal in the graph, we just move frontwards. 
- Start the BFS traversal, pop out an element from the queue every time and travel to all its unvisited neighbors using an adjacency list.

- If the queue becomes empty and no such node is found then there is no cycle in the graph.

```
* Output:  0

* Time Complexity: O(N + 2E) + O(N), Where N = Nodes, 2E is for total degrees as we traverse all adjacent nodes. In the case of connected components of a graph, it will take another O(N) time.

* Space Complexity: O(N) + O(N) ~ O(N), Space for queue data structure and visited array.
