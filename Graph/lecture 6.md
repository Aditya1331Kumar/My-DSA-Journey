# DFS

- Given an undirected connected graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1, the task is to implement both Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) traversals starting from the 0th vertex.
- adjacency list where adj[i] contains a list of vertices connected to vertex i. Visit nodes in the order they appear in the adjacency list.

```java
Examples:


Input: V = 5, adj = [[2, 3, 1], [0], [0, 4], [0], [2]]

Output:[0, 2, 4, 3, 1], [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]

Explanation:

DFS: Start from vertex 0. Visit vertex 2, then vertex 4, backtrack to vertex 0, then visit vertex 3, and finally vertex 1. The traversal is 0 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 1.

BFS: Start from vertex 0. Visit vertices 2, 3, and 1 (in the order they appear in the adjacency list). Then, visit vertex 4 from vertex 2. The traversal is 0 → 2 → 3 → 1 → 4.

```
```java
Input: V = 4, adj = [[1, 3], [2, 0], [1], [0]]

Output: [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 3, 2]

Explanation:

DFS: Start from vertex 0. Visit vertex 1, then vertex 2, backtrack to vertex 0, then visit vertex 3. The traversal is 0 → 1 → 2 → 3.

BFS: Start from vertex 0. Visit vertices 1 and 3, then visit vertex 2 from vertex 1. The traversal is 0 → 1 → 3 → 2.

- DFS is a traversal technique which involves the idea of recursion and backtracking. DFS goes in-depth, i.e., traverses all nodes by going ahead, and when there are no further nodes to traverse in the current path, then it backtracks on the same path and traverses other unvisited nodes. 

- In DFS, we start with a node ‘v’, mark it as visited and store it in the solution vector. It is unexplored as its adjacent nodes are not visited.
- We run through all the adjacent nodes, and call the recursive dfs function to explore the node ‘v’ which has not been visited previously. This leads to the exploration of another node ‘u’ which is its adjacent node and is not visited. 
- The adjacency list stores the list of neighbours for any node. Pick the neighbour list of node ‘v’ and run a for loop on the list of neighbours (say nodes ‘u’ and ‘w’ are in the list). We go in-depth with each node. When node ‘u’ is explored completely then it backtracks and explores node ‘w’.
- This traversal terminates when all the nodes are completely explored. 

```java
import java.util.*;
class Solution {
    
    public static void dfs(int node, boolean vis[], ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, 
    ArrayList<Integer> ls) {
        
        //marking current node as visited
        vis[node] = true;
        ls.add(node);
        
        //getting neighbour nodes
        for(Integer it: adj.get(node)) {
            if(vis[it] == false) {
                dfs(it, vis, adj, ls);
            }
        }
    }
    // Function to return a list containing the DFS traversal of the graph.
    public ArrayList<Integer> dfsOfGraph(int V, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj) {
        //boolean array to keep track of visited vertices
        boolean vis[] = new boolean[V+1];
        vis[0] = true; 
        ArrayList<Integer> ls = new ArrayList<>();
        dfs(0, vis, adj, ls); 
        return ls; 
    }
    
    public static void main(String args[]) {

        ArrayList < ArrayList < Integer >> adj = new ArrayList < > ();
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            adj.add(new ArrayList < > ());
        }
        adj.get(0).add(2);
        adj.get(2).add(0);
        adj.get(0).add(1);
        adj.get(1).add(0);
        adj.get(0).add(3);
        adj.get(3).add(0);
        adj.get(2).add(4);
        adj.get(4).add(2);
        
        Solution sl = new Solution(); 
        ArrayList < Integer > ans = sl.dfsOfGraph(5, adj);
        int n = ans.size(); 
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++) {
            System.out.print(ans.get(i)+" "); 
        }
    }
}
```
- Output: 0 2 4 1 3 

- Time Complexity: For an undirected graph, O(N) + O(2E), For a directed graph, O(N) + O(E), Because for every node we are calling the recursive function once, the time taken is O(N) and 2E is for total degrees as we traverse for all adjacent nodes.

- Space Complexity: O(3N) ~ O(N), Space for dfs stack space, visited array and an adjacency list.
